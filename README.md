# Predicting-Salaries-with-Decision-Trees

In this project we tackle a real-world prediction problem using machine learning.  The dataset used comes from the U.S. Census Bureau; they recorded a number of attributes such as gender and occupation as well as the salary range for a sample of more than 32,000 Americans.  We fit a decision tree to this data, and try to predict the salary for a person we havenâ€™t seen before.I have created a machine learning model using industry standard tools, including Python and sklearn.
